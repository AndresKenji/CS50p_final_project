# **Password Manager**

## CS50

This is the final project for CS50 introduction to programming with Python.

## Features
- **Fastapi**
- **Uvicorn**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Cryptography**

### Description:

My final project is an API in which you can store and retrieve your passwords. It encrypts the password before saving it, so it will remain secure in the database. The only way to decrypt it is within the API. It also has an endpoint to validate if a password is strong or not.

## Run in local

First, you will need to install all the requirements. Go to the project folder and run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt.`

Open your console and navigate to the project folder. Then, run the following command: `python project.py` (if you are using Linux or Mac, use `python3 project.py` instead). Next, open your browser and go to [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

To run test_project.py, you will need to install the httpx library with the following command: `pip install httpx`. This library is necessary for creating and testing the API with a client. After installing httpx, open your console, go to the project folder, and run the following command: `pytest project.py.`
